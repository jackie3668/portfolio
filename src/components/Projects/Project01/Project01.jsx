              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>There is a simple fact that peopleâ€™s life, working and study habits have drastically changed since the start of COVID-19 in 2020. While we do save a lot of time from commuting, but staying isolated at home, lacking physical interaction with peers, constant procrastination, and social media distractions throughout the day hinder our productivity and motivation.</p>

            <p>The study utilized a questionnaire and interviews to explore mental health challenges during Toronto's winter. Participants provided informed consent and answered structured questions. Thematic analysis and the affinity diagram method identified key themes like seasonal mood changes and coping mechanisms. Findings revealed significant winter-induced mental health impacts, underscoring the need for accessible support and effective coping strategies.</p>

            <p>Post-prototype, our focus shifts to user testing and iterative refinement. This process honed my skills in empathetic, user-centered design, and problem-solving. I learned the value of teamwork and diverse perspectives in creating functional, aesthetic solutions. Next, we'll integrate user feedback, emphasizing usability improvements, further advancing my design thinking and user experience strategies.</p>
